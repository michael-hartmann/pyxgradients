# pyxgradients

The module pyxgradients offers the additional color gradients magma, inferno,
plasma and viridis for Pyx. The gradients are taken from
https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py and are now color
maps in matplotlib. More information is available at
https://bids.github.io/colormap/.

There is also an example output for every color gradient available.
